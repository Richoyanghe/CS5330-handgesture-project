<ul>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local.</li>
  <li>Run 'cd CS5330-handgesture-project'.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have python (at least 3.7+) installed on your device. Run 'python -m venv mp_env'.</li>
  <li>On Windows, run './mp_env/Scripts/Activate.ps1'. On Macintosh, run 'source mp_env/bin/activate'.</li>
  <li>Once you have the virtual environment set up, run 'pip install opencv && pip install mediapipe && pip install pygame'.</li>
  <li>Open Another terminal window. Cd to the cloned repository, set up the virtual environment again and run 'cd ./game/Pacman_Complete'</li>
  <li>Make sure you have No.1 terminal window on the 'CS5330-handgesture-project' directory, and have your No.2 terminal window on the 'CS5330-handgesture-project/game/Pacman_Complete' directory. Then, on the No.1 terminal window, run 'python module_test.py', and on your No.2 terminal window, run 'python run.py'. Now you should have your hand detection program and your game open.</li>
